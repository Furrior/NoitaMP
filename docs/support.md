# Support

If you need help or anything looks like to be broken, search the [issues](https://github.com/Ismoh/NoitaMP/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to find a similar problem or [create](https://github.com/Ismoh/NoitaMP/issues/new/choose) a new issue, when there really is something broken! Please do me a favour and first check the old issues. I appreciate it!
